# Snake Game

The Snake Game is back, in Full Screen mode! The live demo is hosted on Cloudflare pages, which can be found [here](https://bit.ly/TaranSnakeGame)

It uses HTML Canvas element painting to paint each frame after every move at time interval of 200ms. The Game is completely written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, using Google Fonts for fonts. Box Blur Algorithm is used to manually blur the image when the game is over. In case you face any issue, feel free to create an issue at this repository, for I plan to maintain this repository  for foreseeable future.
